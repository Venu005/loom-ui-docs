  <Accordion title="Why copy/paste components?">
    The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code,
    allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled. Start with
    some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs. One of
    the drawbacks of packaging the components in an npm package is that the
    style is coupled with the implementation. The design of your components
    should be separate from their implementation.
